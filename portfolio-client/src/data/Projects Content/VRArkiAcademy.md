## About
A project developed as my final project at Vancouver Film School in the VR/AR Design & Development program.
This project was developed in Unity Engine.

## Target
To people that shows interest in architecture, interior design or others that are planning to redecorate their current houses.

## Problem / Solution
It is often a problem for some people to get a sense of scale of the space they are designing in. It is not the same to say 20 by 20 metres than to be a space of 20 by 20 metres. This tool helps to understand the 3d space, for architecture students it is one of the fundamental skills they need to develop to keep evolving their design skills
