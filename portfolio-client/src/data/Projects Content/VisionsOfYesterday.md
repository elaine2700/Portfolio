## About
Visions of Yesterday is an empathy based Virtual Reality application, created to teach users the trials and tribulations associated with dementia.
The intended audience for this project are as follows: dementia care workers, dementia stricken families, and those interested in how VR can teach empathy.

## Vision
This project can help teach our potential audience valuable lessons about dementia, through the use of empathy. The vision of the project is to demonstrate that simple tasks, such as finding one's toothbrush, can be almost insurmountable when one has dementia.
The user is situated in a house with a caretaker to assist them. The goal of this experience is to generate awareness and empathy for those with dementia by focusing on the visual impairments associated with this disorder.
