## About
A project developed as my final project at Vancouver Film School in the VR/AR Design & Development program.
This project was developed in Unity Engine.

## Functionality
This project was made for an assignment at Vancouver Film School. The task consisted in designing a Rube Goldberg Machine in Unreal Engine, using for the most part Physics simulation with the minimum amount of Blueprints.
A Rube Goldberg Machine does a simple tasks in a complicated way by combining multiple objects to create a chain reaction. These machines are fun to watch when they are working, so I designed mine to do a fun task, which was to open a box full of cookies.
